# MyLibrary - A GraphQL Project <img src='https://graphql.org/img/logo.svg' alt='GraphQL Logo' width='40px' height='40px'>
This project was created with...
- **Front-end**: React, Apollo Client
- **Back-end**: Express, GraphQL
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Purpose of the Project
I started this project to learn and test my understanding of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) fundamentals. I started off with reading documentations and watching tutorial videos, before having hands-on attempt at building an end-to-end application (i.e. MyLibrary) using GraphQL for building the APIs.

## Get Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Connect to your MongoDB by providing an URI in the `./server/server.js` file
3. In the `client` directory, run `npm start`
4. In the `server` directory, run `npm run dev`
5. The application should be served at `localhost:3000/`
